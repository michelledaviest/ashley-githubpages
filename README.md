# Ashley theme for Github Pages

A simple, minimalist theme for GitHub pages. This template has been created with academic websites in mind. It should not be too difficult to change to whatever you want. [This](https://michelledaviest.github.io/example-ashley/) is an example Github page with the Ashley theme. <br />

The theme has been inspired by the [Ashley theme for Tumblr sites](https://github.com/jxnblk/Ashley) developed by [jxnblk](https://github.com/jxnblk/Ashley). The Tumblr Ashley theme is responsive while this template is not. If you want to make it responsive, please create a pull request. <br /> 

### To use this theme, 
1. Fork this repository by clicking the "fork" button in the top right.
2. Go to the repository's Settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "\[your GitHub username\].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
3. You can now go to "\[your GitHub username\].github.io" to see your site. You can also check your sites status in Settings>GitHub Pages. Your site should look like [this](https://michelledaviest.github.io/example-ashley/). 
4. The site-wide content can be changed from the index.html file. Please upload your own photograph and CV under the profile-photo and files directories. 

**If you are facing any problems with creating the default site, please file an issue.**
